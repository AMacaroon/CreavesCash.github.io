Hi, so I made a game for calculators whaaat... that's fun. If you have a **Casio Prism** or a **Casio fx-CG50** (It might work on others, idk), then give it a try! It's a very short existential text-based game, might make it longer in the future. I think there's an emulator somewhere, like on the Casio Website, so try that if you don't wanna splash for the calculator
